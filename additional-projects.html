    <!-- Project 1: Audio Syllabus -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Happily Ever After? Audio Syllabus with Sound Design & Narration</h2>
            
            <div class="project-challenge overlay-gold">
                <h3>Challenge:</h3>
                <p>Transform a traditional written syllabus for a Fairy Tale Literature course into an engaging audio experience that not only conveys essential course information but builds genuine excitement for the subject matter, while ensuring accessibility for auditory learners and visually impaired students.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-approach">
                <h3>Approach:</h3>
                <p>Rather than simply reading the syllabus aloud, I designed a narrative audio journey that introduces the course's central question: How do Disney's sanitized fairy tales compare to the dark, morally complex originals by the Brothers Grimm and earlier folk storytellers?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-video">
                <h3>The Audio Production:</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="production-process overlay-teal">
                <h3>Production Process:</h3>
                <h4>Scriptwriting:</h4>
                <p>Adapted dry syllabus content into conversational, story-driven narration that mirrors the course's "light vs. dark" theme</p>
                
                <h4>Voiceover Recording:</h4>
                <p>Self-recorded narration with varied pacing and tone to maintain listener engagement across 8+ minutes</p>
                
                <h4>Sound Design:</h4>
                <p>Layered atmospheric sound effects matched to specific fairy tales:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wolf howl for "Little Red Riding Hood"</li>
                    <li>Glass slipper clicks on marble for "Cinderella"</li>
                    <li>Forest ambience transitioning from ominous to magical</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Music Integration:</h4>
                <p>Composed a score that shifts between haunting minor keys (Grimm's dark tales) and bright major keys (Disney's versions)</p>
                
                <h4>Audio Editing:</h4>
                <p>Mixed multiple tracks in Adobe Audition, balancing narration clarity with immersive soundscape</p>
            </div>

            <div class="impact overlay-pink">
                <h3>Impact:</h3>
                <p>The audio syllabus demonstrates that accessibility doesn't mean sacrificing creativity or engagement. By treating course information as a storytelling opportunity, the project models how instructional designers can make required content compelling rather than perfunctory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="skills-box">
                <h3>Skills Demonstrated:</h3>

                <p><strong>Personal Note:</strong> This project ignited a love for voice work and sound design, proving that even "dry" content like syllabi can become engaging when approached creatively. It also deepened my appreciation for how audio can transform accessibility from checkbox compliance into genuine inclusion.</p>

            <div class="project-why">
                <h3>Why This Project Matters:</h3>
                <p>While video production isn't my primary passion, this project built critical skills and confidence for multimedia instructional design. It demonstrates the ability to independently manage complex production workflows, a valuable asset when creating video-based training modules or eLearning content that requires original footage.</p>
                <p>The storyboard-to-screen process mirrors professional instructional video development, showing strategic planning, technical execution, and attention to both educational clarity and production quality.</p>

            <p>Wondering what my design process actually looks like? This collection pulls back the curtain.</p>
            <p>From hierarchical task analyses to branching scenario storyboards, these artifacts show how I think through instructional design challenges—the systematic planning, iterative refinement, and evidence-based decision-making that happens before a single learner ever sees the final product.</p>
            <p>If you're evaluating potential partners for instructional design projects, curriculum development, or professional development creation, these examples demonstrate how I work: my communication style, attention to detail, theoretical frameworks, and ability to translate complex content into structured learning pathways.</p>

                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>This capstone project demonstrates full-cycle instructional design from initial needs analysis through final course development. The challenge: create accessible, evidence-based professional development that equips K-5 educators to recognize student brain states (Owl, Watchdog, Possum) and implement trauma-informed co-regulation strategies, without requiring teachers to become neuroscience experts or spending hours in traditional lecture-based training.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="design-approach">
                <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                <p>Using a systematic instructional design methodology (ADDIE framework), I conducted a needs analysis through teacher interviews and a literature review, identifying a critical gap: educators understand that the "behavior is communication" conceptually, but lack practical tools to decode what students are communicating and respond effectively in the moment. This insight shaped the entire course architecture.</p>
                <p>The resulting 4-week online course applies trauma-informed principles not only to the content (teaching about trauma) but also to the delivery method (creating psychologically safe learning experiences for teachers).</p>
                
                <h4>Design features include:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scaffolded progression from "why" (neuroscience foundation) through "what" (brain state recognition) to "how" (practical strategies)</li>
                    <li>Scenario-based practice in risk-free simulated environments</li>
                    <li>Performance-based assessments that produce immediately usable classroom tools</li>
                    <li>Multimodal content delivery (video, text, interactive activities) to accommodate diverse learning preferences</li>
                    <li>Community-building elements (discussion boards, peer feedback) that combat teacher isolation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
                <p>By the end of this 4-week course, K-5 teachers will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explain the neurobiological impact of trauma on brain development and behavior</li>
                    <li>Identify the student's brain state (Owl, Watchdog, Possum) based on observable behavioral cues</li>
                    <li>Select and implement appropriate co-regulation strategies matched to student brain states</li>
                    <li>Design individualized support plans for trauma-impacted students in their classrooms</li>
                    <li>Modify classroom environments and routines to promote regulation and felt safety</li>

                    <li><strong>Owl-Watchdog-Possum Framework (Robyn Gobbel):</strong> Accessible metaphor for brain states aligned with polyvagal theory</li>
                    <li><strong>The Whole-Brain Child (Dr. Dan Siegel & Dr. Tina Payne Bryson):</strong> Upstairs/downstairs brain concept</li>

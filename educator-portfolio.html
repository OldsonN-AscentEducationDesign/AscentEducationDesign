                <h2>Understanding Trauma: Interactive Click-Through Module for Educators</h2>
                
                <div class="project-intro overlay-gold">
                    <h3>The Challenge:</h3>
                    <p>Early in my graduate program, I believed the solution to supporting trauma-impacted students was curriculum - SEL-integrated reading and writing lessons that would teach children regulation skills alongside academic content. This Adobe Captivate module was designed to explain trauma's impact on developing brains as the foundation for that curriculum vision.</p>

                    <h3>The Design:</h3>
                    <p>This interactive click-through experience guides educators through the neuroscience of trauma, helping them understand how adverse experiences literally shape brain architecture and behavior patterns. Using branching scenarios, embedded quizzes, video explanations, and audio narration, the module makes complex neuroscience accessible to busy teachers who need practical understanding, not academic theory.</p>

                <div class="project-pivot">
                    <h3>The Pivot:</h3>
                    <p>What I didn't realize when I created this project: I was building teacher training, not curriculum. The module succeeded in translating brain science into educator-friendly content - but it also revealed a critical gap. Children knowing SEL strategies isn't enough if their dysregulated nervous systems prevent them from accessing those tools. Teachers need to understand brain states and co-regulation BEFORE curriculum-embedded SEL can work.</p>
                    <p>This project marked my transition from curriculum designer to professional development specialist - from "what should we teach kids?" to "what do teachers need to know to help dysregulated kids access learning?" It was created before my daughter started kindergarten, before I fully understood that knowing ≠ accessing. Looking back, this was the moment my mission shifted to building the bridge between neuroscience knowledge and classroom co-regulation practice.</p>

            <div class="project-intro">
                <h3>Try It Yourself: "The Morning Meltdown" Interactive Scenario</h3>
                <p><strong>What This Is:</strong> A realistic classroom scenario where YOU make the decisions. When your student arrives on Monday morning, they will already be on edge. How you respond in the first 60 seconds will determine whether they settle into learning or escalate into a crisis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-how-it-works">
                <h3>How It Works:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Observe:</strong> Watch the students' behavior and body language as they enter the classroom</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify:</strong> Decide which brain state they're in (Owl, Watchdog, or Possum)</li>
                    <li><strong>Respond:</strong> Choose how you'll interact; your choice creates different outcomes</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Get immediate feedback on why your approach helped or escalated</li>
                    <li><strong>Try Again:</strong> Make different choices to see alternative pathways</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-why overlay-pink">
                <h3>Why Practice Matters:</h3>
                <p>When a real student is melting down, you have seconds to respond, not time to think through options or consult your notes. This scenario lets you build that instant pattern recognition WITHOUT the stress of a real crisis or the risk of making things worse for an actual child.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-testimonials">
                <h3>What Teachers Say:</h3>
                <blockquote>"I totally would have asked too many questions and overwhelmed him. The scenario showed me exactly why that backfires when a student is in Possum brain."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Seeing the consequences of my choices was huge. I didn't realize how my frustrated tone was escalating my Watchdog students."</blockquote>

            <div class="project-cta">
                <p><strong>Time:</strong> 10-15 minutes | <strong>Best For:</strong> Teachers who want hands-on practice recognizing brain states before trying strategies with real students</p>
